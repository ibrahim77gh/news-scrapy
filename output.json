{"title": "WA high court upholds state Voting Rights Act. Now, a county must change its elections", "content": "\n\nThe Washington Supreme Court unanimously dismissed arguments that the Washington Voting Rights Act was unconstitutional, ruling in favor of three local members of the League of United Latin American Citizens who brought the case against Franklin County. The Court ordered that James Gimenez must pay attorney fees to the UCLA Voting Rights Projects attorneys representing the three individuals. The ruling enabled changes to start in 2024 making elections more fair for Latino voters by moving from at-large to district-based elections. The court determined that the Voting Rights Act protects all Washington voters from discrimination on the basis of race, color and language, thus all voters are part of a protected class."},

{"title": "Federal judge blasts WA officials for mental health settlement failures", "content": "\nThe Washington Department of Social and Health Services is being forced to answer for delays in jails related to the mental health of individuals. This struggle has been going on for nearly a decade, in which a settlement had been agreed to with Disability Rights Washington, but the WA DSHS has not been able to meet its timelines and has incurred nearly $100 million in fines. Despite efforts to resolve the backlog with alternative facilities, the court monitor and counties involved in the case are pointing to lack of urgency from WA DSHS to accommodate the backlog of mental health patients. Judge Marsha J. Pechman is expected to issue a ruling on increased fines, changing patient acceptance or a new settlement agreement in the coming weeks."},

Washington state lawmakers have allocated more than $7 million to address the dams' unfortunate effects and the Biden administration is supportive of their removal.

{"title": "​​Harrell’s approach to fentanyl crisis: Heavy on spectacle, light on substance", "content": "\nSeattle faces a difficult decision around how to balance safety and compassion for people struggling with addiction. A proposed ordinance to prosecute public drug use and possession failed in a 5-4 council vote recently, prompting criticism and debate. Councilmember Andrew Lewis changed his vote at the last moment due to his doubts on its effectiveness. Mayor Bruce Harrell has formed a 24-person work group to develop a new plan focusing on harm reduction, treatment, and alignment to state law. The plan must also ensure a balance between avoiding arrest of the poor and people of color and avoiding the unmonitored use of drugs in public. We must consider evidence-based outcomes and costs to avoid exacerbating the crisis, which caused 371 deaths in the city last year. Mayor Harrell's plan will show Seattle's priorities going forward."},
